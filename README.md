# Database of Starship Elements and Starship-associated Genes

## Main structure

- `ships`: full Starship sequences
- `captain`:`tyr` gene
- `cargo`: `nlr`, `fre`, `plp`, and `duf3723` genes

Each folder contains:

- blast databases for BLAST and HMMER searches
  - a `combined` nucleotide database for `ships`
  - individual nucleotide and protein databases for each `captain` and `cargo` gene
- multiple sequence alignments used to build phylogenetic trees
